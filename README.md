# Homepage

Simple homepage written, to skill-up in Svelte.
Site features 3 search engines
- `Google` - Currently most used Internet Search Engine in the world. <i>I guess i don't have to explain, what's Google :/</i>
- `DuckDuckGo` - More Privacy focused Search Engine. Good for searching for some things, that you might want to stay private. Very simmilar to Google, can be used with [Bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bangs)
- `Perplexity` - Perplexity AI is a new AI chat tool that acts as an extremely powerful search engine. When a user inputs a question, the model scours the web for relevant information and provides answers. It can also show users the source of their search

## How to use this efficiently

- When you're willing to use Google, simply enter your phrase, and click enter or return on your iOS/iPadOS keyboard
- When you're willing to use something diffrent, enter your phase, and click on the logo of Search Engine you want to use.
